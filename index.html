                            I have been dancing since I was 6 years old. I started with weekly trainings in Latin dancing and Ballroom dancing, and I attended several national competitions as a child. When I was in high school, I started practicing urban choreographies including hiphop, jazz funk. In college, I joined the FL crew and won national dance championship. This year, I started to teach dance classes on my own.

                        DIY always was one of my biggest passions. Though not professionally trained, I love to paint or build DIY projects whenever I can. For the past year, I developed interest in sewing, which basically means making cloths from scratch.

                            It was not until I started living by myself that I begin to discover interest in cooking, but it turns out that I am not bad at it. I watched my grandmother cook since I was a child, and I guess I learned more than I even realized. When I have to feed myself, I quickly found a path to do it in my way and got a little bit more creative.
